        <h3>Separate Legal Entity:</h3>
        <p>
          A company exists as a separate legal entity which is different from
          its shareholders and members. Due to this feature, shareholders can
          enter into a contract with the company and can also sue the company
          and be sued by the company.

        <h3>Corporate Body:</h3>
        <p>
          A company needs to be registered under the Companies Act, 2013. Any
          other organisation incorporated with the Registrar of Companies, and
          subsequently not registered cannot be considered as a company.

        <h3>Transferability of Shares:</h3>
        <p>
          Shareholders of a public limited company can transfer their shares as
          per the rules laid down in the articles of association. However, in
          case of a private limited company, there might be some restrictions on
          the transfer of shares.

        <h3>Training services</h3>
        <p>
          A company may benefit from hiring a training company to teach
          employees specific computer skills or soft skills. In these cases, the
          company may hire an outside party to lead training sessions, workshops
          or presentations to help team members improve or learn a certain
          skill.

        <p>
          If a company is hosting a special event, works with a sensitive
          subject or is in a highly populated area, it may hire security
          services to ensure the safety of its employees and guests. Companies
          can hire security professionals for single events or for daily
          operations.

      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        A finance company is an organization that makes loans to individuals and
        businesses. Unlike a bank, a finance company does not receive cash
        deposits from clients, nor does it provide some other services common to
        banks, such as checking accounts.
